# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard - Power BI Project

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard I built using live weather data pulled from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The goal was to create a clear, interactive visual that helps users quickly understand the current and upcoming weather in different cities — along with air quality and other key environmental metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Tool:** Power BI  
- **Data Source:** WeatherAPI (free plan)  
- **Refresh Frequency:** Daily (automated refresh set in Power BI Service)  
- **Focus Cities:** Atlanta, Dallas, and Chicago... 
- **Forecast Range:** Current conditions + 7-day forecast  

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Temperature Trends**: Daily high temperatures shown across the week  
- **Air Quality Metrics**: Including PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and Ozone levels  
- **Humidity & Wind**: Live humidity %, wind speed, and visibility  
- **UV Index & Pressure**: Helps assess sun exposure risks and atmospheric pressure  
- **Sunrise & Sunset**: Daily times to help with planning  
- **Rain Forecast**: Visual chance of rain for each day  
- **Clean Layout**: Built with usability in mind — even non-technical users can navigate it easily  

## 🔁 Real-Time Refresh

I set up a **daily data refresh**, so each time someone opens the dashboard, they see the latest available weather data for that day. This is ideal for real-world applications where up-to-date info matters (e.g., travel, health, or event planning).

## 🌤️ What the Data Tells Us

As of the latest snapshot:
- **Atlanta** shows partly cloudy skies with temperatures around 29°C, moderate humidity (~67%), and clean air quality.
- **Chicago** is cooler, around 21.7°C, with stable weather conditions and a higher chance of rain mid-week.
- **Dallas** is currently the warmest at 31.7°C, but with minimal rain and decent visibility.

Air quality readings across all cities are in the “Good” range, making outdoor activities generally safe.

## 🧠 Skills Used

- Power BI  
- API integration  
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
- DAX for calculations and visuals  
- Scheduled data refresh using Power BI Service
